#Time

- Wall time(or real time). This is the actual time and date int the real world.
- Process time. This is the time that a process spends executing on a processor. It can be a measurement of the time the process itself spent executing(user time) or the time the kernel spent working on the process's behalf(system time).
- Monotonic time. This time source is strictly linearly increasing. Most operating systems, Linux included, use the system's uptime(time since boot) for this purpose.

Operating systems track the progression of time via the software clock, a clock maintained by the kernel in software. The kernel instantiates a periodic timer, known as the system timer, that pops at a specific frequency. When a timer interval ends, the kernel increments the elapsed time by one unit, known as a tick or jiffy. The counter of elapsed ticks is known as the jiffies counter.


##Time's Data Structures
```C
#include <time.h>

// the original representation, represent the number of elapsed seconds since the epoch
typedef long time_t;


#include <sys/time.h>

// and now, microsecond precision
// suseconds_t is normally a typedef to an integer type
struct timeval {
	time_t tv_sec;	/* seconds */
	suseconds_t tv_usec; /* microseconds */
};


#include <time.h>

// even better, nanosecond precision
struct timespec {
	time_t tv_sec; /* seconds*/
	long tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */
};


#include <time.h>

// breaking down time
struct tm {
	int tm_sec;
	int tm_min;
	int tm_hour;
	int tm_mday;
	int tm_mon;
	int tm_year;
	int tm_wday;
	int tm_yday;
	int tm_isdst;
#ifdef _BSD_SOURCE
	long tm_gmtoff;
	const char *tm_zone;
#endif
};

// the type clock_t represents clock ticks, often long
// the ticks that clock_t represent are the system's actual timer frequency
```

##POSIX Clocks
The type `clockid_t` represents a specific POSIX clock, five of which Linux supports:

- CLOCK_REALTIME. The system-wide real time clock.
- CLOCK_MONOTONIC. A monotonically increasing clcok that is not settable by any process. It represents the elapsed time since some unspecified starting point, such as system boot.
- CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW. Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, except the clock is not eligible for slewing.
- CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID. A high-resolution, per-process clock available from the processor.
- CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID. Similar to the per-process clock, but unique to each thread in a process.

###Time Source Resolution
```C
#include <time.h>

int clock_getres(clockid_t clock_id,
				  struct timespec *res);
```
A successful call to `clock_getres()` stores the resolution of the clock specified by clock_id in res if it is not NULL and returns 0.

##Getting the Current Time of Day
```C
#include <time.h>

time_t time(time_t *t);
```
A call to `time()` returns the current time represented as the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch. If the parameter t is not NULL, the function also writes the current time into the provided pointer.

###A Better Interface

```C
#include <sys/time.h>

int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv,
				  struct timezone *tz);
```
A successful call to `gettimeofday()` places the current time in the timeval structure pointed at by tv and returns 0.

###An Advaned Interface
POSIX provides the `clock_gettime()` interface for obtaining the time of a specific time source.

```C
#include <time.h>

int clock_gettime(clockid_t clock_id,
				   struct timespec *ts);
```

###Getting the Process Time
The `times()` system call retrieves the process time of the running process and its children, in clock ticks.

```C
#include <sys/time.h>

struct tms {
	clock_t tms_utime;	/* user time consumed */
	clock_t tms_stime; /* system time consumed */
	clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time consumed by children */
	clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time consumed by children */
};

clock_t times(struct tms *buf);
```

##Setting the Current time of Day
```C
#define _SVID_SOURCE
#include <time.h>

int stime(time_t *t);
```

###Setting Time with Precision
```C
#include <sys/time.h>

int settimeofday(const struct timeval *tv,
				  const struct timezone *tz);
```

###An Advanced Interface for Setting the Time
```C
#include <time.h>

int clock_settime(clockid_t clock_id,
				   const struct timespec *ts);
```

##Playing with Time
```C
#inlude <time.h>

// convert a tm structure to an ASCII string
char *asctime(const struct tm *tm);
// multithreaded programs should use asctime_r. Instead of returning a pointer to a statically allocated string, this function uses the string provided via buf, which must be at least 26 characters in length
char *asctime_r(const struct tm *tm, char *buf);

// convert a time_t to its ASCII representation
char *ctime(const time_t *timep);
char *ctime_r(const time_t *timep, char *buf);

// convert time_t to a tm structure, expressed in terms of the UTC time zone
struct tm* gmtime(const time_t* timep);
struct tm* gmtime_r(const time_t* timep, struct tm *result);

// expressed in terms of the user's time zone
struct tm* localtime(const time_t *timep);
struct tm* localtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);

// the number of seconds that have elapsed between two time_t values
double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time0);
```

##Tuning the System Clock
```C
#include <sys/time.h>

int adjtime(const struct timeval *delta,
			struct timeval *olddelta);
			
int adjtimex(struct timex *adj);
struct timex {
	int modes;
	long offset;
	long freq;
	long maxerror;
	long esterror;
	int status;
	long constant;
	long precision;
	long tolerance;
	struct timeval time;
	long tick;
};
```
A successful call to `adjtime()` instructs the kernel to slowly begin ajusting the time as stipulated by delta. If the time specified by delta is positive, the kernel speeds up the system clock by delta until the correction is fully applied. If the time specified by delta is negative, the kernel slows down the system clock until the correction is applied. The adjustment will not move the clock backward; instead, the clock slows down until the system time converges with the corrected time.

##Sleeping and Waiting
```C
#include <unistd.h>

unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);
int usleep(useconds_t usec);

#include <time.h>

int nanosleep(const struct timespec *req,
			   struct timespec *rem);
int clock_nanosleep(clockid_t clock_id,
					 int flags,
					 const struct timespec *req,
					 struct timepsec *rem);

// A protable way to sleep
#include <sys/select.h>
int select(int n,
			fd_set *readfds,
			fd_set *writefds,
			fd_set *exceptfds,
			struct timeval *timeout);
```

##Timers
Timers provide a mechanism for notifying a process when a given amount of time elapses.

###Simple Alarms
```C
#include <unistd.h>

unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);
```
A call to this function schedules the delivery of a SIGALRM signal to the invoking process after seconds of real time have elapsed. If a previously scheduled signal was pending, the call cancels the alarm, replaces it with the newly requested alarm, and returns the number of seconds remaining in the previous alarm. If seconds is 0, the previous alarm, if any, is canceled, but no new alarm is scheduled.

Successful use of this function thus also requires registering a signal handler for the SIGALRM signal.

###Interval Timers
```C
#include <sys/time.h>

int getitimer(int which,
			   struct itimerval *value);
int setitimer(int which,
			   const struct itimerval *value,
			   struct itimerval *ovalue);
			   
struct itimerval {
	struct timeval it_interval; /* next value */
	struct timeval it_value; /* current value */
};

// an example
void alarm_handler(int signo)
{
	printf("Timer hit!\n");
}

void foo()
{
	struct itimerval delay;
	int ret;
	
	signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
	
	delay.it_value.tv_sec = 5;
	delay.it_value.tv_usec = 0;
	delay.it_interval.tv_sec = 1;
	delay.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;
	ret = setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &delay, NULL);
	
	pause();
}
```

###Advanced Timer

####Creating a Timer

```C
#include <signal.h>
#include <time.h>

int timer_create(clockid_t clockid,
				  struct sigevent *evp,
				  timer_t *timerid);
				  
struct sigevent {
	union sigval sigev_value;
	int sigev_signo;
	int sigev_notify;
	void (*sigev_notify_function)(union sigval);
	pthread_attr_t *sigev_notify_attributes;
};

union sigval {
	int sigval_int;
	void *sigval_ptr;
};
```

####Arming a timer

```C
#include <time.h>

int timer_settime(timer_t timerid,
				   int flags,
				   const struct itimerspec *value,
				   struct itimerspec *ovalue);
				   
struct itimerspec {
	struct timespec it_interval;
	struct timespec it_value;
};	
```

####Obtaining the expiration of a timer

```C
#include <time.h>

int timer_gettime(timer_t timerid,
				   struct itimerspec *value);
```

####Obtaining the overrun of a timer

```C
#include <time.h>

int timer_getoverrun(timer_t timerid);
```

####Deleting a timer

```C
#include <time.h>

int timer_delete(timer_t timerid);
```
