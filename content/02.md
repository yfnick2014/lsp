##File I/O
The kernel maintains a per-process list of open files, called the file table. This table is indexed via nonnegative integers known as file descriptors. Each entry in the list contains information about an open file, including a pointer to an in-memory copy of the file's backing inode and associated metadata(file positions and access modes etc).

###Opening Files
####The open() System Call
```
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *name, int flags);
int open(const char *name, int flags, mode_t mode);
```

***flags for open()***

O_APPEND (append mode)

O_SYNC (a signal will be generated when the specified file becomes readable or writable)

O_CLOEXEC (Upon executing a new process, the file will automatically be closed)

O_CREAT (create the file if not exists, has not effect unless O_EXCL is also given)

O_DIRECT (opened for direct I/O)

O_DIRECTORY (If name is not a directory, the call to open() will fail)

O_EXCL (when given with O_CREAT, this flag will cause the call to open() to fail if the file given by name already exists)

O_LARGEFILE (be opened using 64-bit offsets, allowing the manipulation of files larger than two gigabytes)

O_NOATIME+ (file's last access time is not updated upon read)

O_NOCTTY (If the given name refers to a terminal device, it will not become the process's controlling terminal)

O_NOFOLLOW (If name is a symbolic link, the call to open() will fail)

O_NONBLOCK (the file will be opened in nonblocking mode)

O_SYNC (opened for synchronous I/O. No write will complete until the data has been physically written to disk)

O_TRUNC (in writing mode, the file will be truncated to zero length)

***mode for open()***

S_IWUSR (Owner has write permission)

S_IXUSR (Owner has execute permission)

S_IRWXG (Owner has read, write and exeucte permission)

S_IRGRP (Group has read permission)

S_IWGRP (Group has write permission)

S_IXGRP (Group has execute permission)

S_IRWXO (Everyone else has read, write and execute permission)

S_IROTH (Everyone else has read permission)

S_IWOTH (Everyone else has write permission)

S_IXOTH (Everyone else has execute permission)

####The creat() function
```
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int creat(const char *name, mode_t mode);

// eg:
int fd;

fd = creat(filename, 0644);
// identical to
// fd = open(filename, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
```

###Reading via read()
```
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t len);
```
####Return Values
- The call returns a value equal to len. All len read bytes are stored in buf.
- The call returns a value less than len, but greater than zero. This can occur because a signal interrupted the read midway; an error occurred in the middle of the read; more than zero, but less than len bytes' worth of data was available; or EOF was reached before len bytes were read.
- The call returns 0. This indicates EOF.
- The call blocks because no data is currently available. This won't happen in nonblocking mode.
- The call returns -1, and errno is set to EINTR. (a signal was received before any bytes were read, which can be reissued).
- The call returns -1, and errno is set to EAGAIN. (the read would block because no data is currently available, which can be reissued, happen in nonblocking mode only).
- The call returns -1, and errno is set to a value other than EINTR or EAGAIN(indicates a more serious error).

####Reading all the bytes
```
ssize_t ret;

while (len != 0 && (ret = read(fd, buf, len)) != 0) {
	if (ret == -1) {
		if (errno == EINTR)
			continue;
		perror("read");
		break;
	}
	
	len -= ret;
	buf += ret;
}
```

####Nonblocking reads
```
char buf[BUFSIZ];
ssize_t nr;

start:
nr = read(fd, buf, BUFSIZ);
if (nr == -1) {
	if (errno == EINTR)
		goto start;
	if (errno == EAGAIN)
		/* resubmit later */
	else
		/* error */
}
```

####Other error values
EBADF (The given file descriptor is invalid or is not open for reading)

EFAULT (The pointer provided by buf is not inside the calling process's address space)

EINVAL (The file descriptor is mapped to an object that does not allow reading)

EIO (A low-level I/O error occured)

####Size limits on read()
ssize_t type is a signed version of size_t. The maximum value of size_t is SIZE_MAX; the maximum value of an ssize_t is SSIZE_MAX. If len is larger than SSIZE_MAX, the results of the call to read() are undefined.

###Writing with write()
```
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

####Partial writes
```
ssize_t ret, nr;

while(len != 0 && (ret = write(fd, buf, len)) != 0) {
	if (ret == -1) {
		if (errno == EINTR)
			continue;
		perror("write");
		break;
	}
	
	len -= ret;
	buf += ret;
}
```

####Other error codes
EBADF (The given file descriptor is not valid or is not open for writing)

EFAULT (The pointer provided by buf points outside of the process's address space)

EFBIG (The write would have made the file larger than per-process maximum file, or internal implementation, limits)

EINVAL (The given file descriptor is mapped to an object that is not suitable for writing)

EIO (A low-level I/O error occurred)

ENOSPC (The filesystem backing the given file descriptor does not have sufficient space)

EPIPE (The given file descriptor is associated with a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed. The process will also receive a SIGPIPE signal)

####Behavior of write()
When a call to write() returns, the kernel has copied the data from the supplied buffer into a kernel buffer, but there is no guarantee that the data has been written out to its intended destination.

delayed writes issues

- The delayed writes do not change POSIX semantics.
- the inability to enforce write ordering.
- the reporting of certain I/O errors.(any I/O error that occurs during writeback cannot be reported back to the process that issued the write request)

how to minimize the risks of deferred writes
- the kernel institutes a maximum buffer age and writes out all dirty buffers before the mature past the given value(/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs)
- it's possible to force the writeback of a given file's buffer, or even to make all writes synchronous
