#Advanced Process Management
##Process Scheduling
The process scheduler is the kernel subsystem that divides the finite resource of processor time among a system's processes. Multitasking operating systems come into two variants: cooperative and preemptive. The preemptive scheduler decides when one process is to stop running and a different process is to resume. In cooperative multitasking, conversely, a process does not stop running until it voluntarily decides to do so.

###Timeslices
The timeslice that the process scheduler allots to each process is an important variable in the overall behavior and performance of a system.

###I/O- Versus Processor-Bound Processes
Processes that continually consume all of their available timeslices are considered processor-bound. Such processes are hungry for CPU time and will consume all that the scheduler gives them. On the other hand, processes that spend more time blocked waiting for some resource than executing are considered I/O-bound. I/O-bound processes are often issuing and waiting for file or network I/O, blocking on keyboard input, or waiting for the user to move the mouse.

Processor- and I/O-bound applications differ in the type of scheduler behavior from which they most benefit. Process-bound applications crave the largest timeslices possible, allowing them to maximize cache hit rates and get their jobs done as quickly as possible. In contrast, I/O-bound processes do not necessarily need large timeslices because they typically run for only very short periods before issuing I/O requests and blocking on some kernel resource.
