###Block Size
A large performance gain is realized simply by performing operations in chunks that are integer multiples or divisors of the block size.

It is possible to implement user buffering by hand in your own programs. Indeed, many mission-critical applications do just that. The vast majority of programs, however, make use of the popular standard I/O library(part of the standard C library) or the iostream(part of the standard C++ library), which provides a robust and capable user-buffering solution.
##Standard I/O
The standard C library provides the standard I/O library(often simply called stdio), which in turn provides a platform-independent, user-buffering solution.

Standard I/O routines do not operate directly on file descriptors. Instead, they use their own unique identifier, known as the file pointer. Inside the C library, the file pointer maps to a file descriptor.
##Opening Files
```C
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
```
`mode` argument:

- r (open the file for reading)
- r+ (open the file both for reading and writing)
- w (open the file for writing. If the file exists, it is truncated to zero length. If the file does not exist, it is created)
- w+ (open the file for reading and writing. If the file exists, it is truncated to zero length. If the file does not exist, it is created)
- a (open the file for writing in append mode. The file is created if it does not exist)
- a+ (open the file both for reading and writing in append mode. The file is created if it does not exist)

Upon success, `fopen()` returns a valid FILE pointer. On failure, it returns NULL and sets errno appropriately.

```C
FILE *stream;

stream = fopen("/etc/manifest", "r");
if (!stream)
	/* error */
```

##Opening a Stream via File Descriptor
```C
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char* mode);
```
The function `fdopen()` converts an already open file descriptor(fd) to a stream. The possible modes are the same as for `fopen()` and must be compatible with the modes originally used to open the file descriptor. The mode w and w+ may be specified, but they will not caused truncation. The stream is positioned at the file position associated with the file descriptor.

Once a file descriptor is converted to a stream, it's recommended that I/O should no longer be directly performed on the file descriptor. Closing the stream will close the file descriptor as well.

```C
FILE *stream;
int fd;

fd = open("/home/kidd/map.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1)
	/* error */

stream = fdopen(fd, "r");
if (!stream)
	/* error */
```
##Closing Streams
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fclose(FILE *stream);
```

The `fclose()` function closes a given stream, any buffered and not-yet-written data is first flushed. On success, `fclose()` returns 0. On failure, it returns EOF and set errno appropriately.
###Closing All Streams
```C
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h

int fcloseall(void);
```

The `fcloseall()` function closes all streams associated with the current process, including standard in, standard out, and standard error. Before closing, all streams are flushed.
##Reading from a Stream
###Reading a Character at a Time
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fgetc(FILE *stream);
```

This function reads the next character from stream and returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int.

```C
int c;

c = fgetc(stream);
if (c == EOF)
	/* error */
else
	printf("c=%c\n", (char)c);
```

####Putting the character back
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);
```
Each call pushes back c, cast to an unsigned char, onto stream. On success, c is returned; on failure, EOF is returned.

###Reading an Entire Line
```C
#include <stdio.h>

char *fgets(char *str, int size, FILE *stream);
```
This function reads up to one less than size bytes from stream and stores the results in str. A null character(`\0`) is stored in the buffer after the last byte read in. Reading stops after an EOF or a newline character is reached. If a newline is read, the `\n` is stored in str. On success, str is returned; on failure, NULL is returned.

```C
char buf[LINE_MAX];

if (!fgets(buf, LINE_MAX, stream))
	/* error */
```

###Reading Binary Data
```C
#include <stdio.h>

size_t fread(void *buf, size_t size, size_t nr, FILE *stream);
```
A call to `fread()` will read up to nr elements of data, each of size bytes, from stream into buffer pointed by buf.

The number of elements read(not the number of bytes read!) is returned. The function indicates or EOF via a return value less than nr. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know which of the two conditions occurred without using `ferror()` and `feof()`.
##Writing to a Stream
###Writing a Single Character
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);
```
The `fputc()` function writes the byte specified by c(cast to an unsigned char) to the stream pointed at by stream. Upon successful completion, the function returns c. Otherwise, it returns EOF, and errno is set appropriately.

###Writing a String of Characters
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fputs(const char* str, FILE *stream);
```

###Writing Binary Data
```C
#include <stdio.h>

size_t fwrite(void *buf,
			  size_t size,
			  size_t nr,
			  FILE *stream);
```
##Sample Program Using Buffered I/O
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	FILE *in, *out;
	struct pirate {
		char name[100];			/* real name */
		unsigned long booty;	/* in pounds sterling */
		unsigned int beard_len; /* in inches */
	} p, blackbeard = { "Edward Teach", 950, 48 };

	out = fopen("data", "w");
	if (!out) {
		perror("fopen");
		return 1;
	}
	
	if (!fwrite(&blackbeard, sizeof(struct pirate), 1, out)) {
		perror("fwrite");
		return 1;
	}

	if (fclose(out)) {
		perror("fclose");
		return 1;
	}

	in = fopen("data", "r");
	if (!in) {
		perror("fopen");
		return 1;
	}

	if (!fread(&p, sizeof(struct pirate), 1, in)) {
		perror("fread");
		return 1;
	}

	if (fclose(in)) {
		perror("fclose");
		return 1;
	}

	printf("name=\"%s\" booty=%lu beard_len=%u\n",
			p.name, p.booty, p.beard_len);

	return 0;
}
```
##Seeking a Stream
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
int fsetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos);
void rewind(FILE *stream);

long ftell(FILE *stream);
int fgetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos);
```
##Flushing a Stream
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fflush(FILE *stream);
```
On invocation, any unwritten data in the stream pointed to by stream is flushed to the kernel. If stream is NULL, all open input streams in the process are flushed. On success, `fflush()` returns 0. On failure, it returns EOF, and errno is set appropriately.
##Errors and End-of-File
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int ferror(FILE *stream);
int feof(FILE *stream);
void clearerr(FILE *stream);
```
##Obtaining the Associated File Descriptor
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int fileno(FILE *stream);
```
##Controlling the Buffering
Standard I/O implements three types of user buffering and provides developers with an interface for controlling the type and size of the buffer.

- Unbuffered (No user buffering is performed. Data is submitted directly to the kernel.)
- Line-buffered (Buffering is performed on a per-line basis. With each newline chracter, the buffer is submitted to the kernel.)
- Block-buffered (Buffering is performed on a per-block basis, where a block is a fixed number of bytes.)

Most of the time, the default buffering type is correct and optimal. However, standard I/O does provide an interface for controlling the type of buffering employed:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);
```
The `setvbuf()` function sets the buffering type of stream to mode, which must be one of the following:

- IONBF (Unbuffered)
- IOLBF (Line-buffered)
- IOFBF (Block-buffered)
##Thread Safety
The standard I/O functioins are inherently thread-safe.
###Manual File Locking
```C
#include <stdio.h>

// waits until stream is no longer locked,
// bumps the lock count, and then acquire the lock
void flockfile(FILE *stream);

// decrements the lock count associated with stream
// If the lock count reaches zero, the current thread
// relinquishes ownership of the stream.
// Another thread is now able to acquire the lock
void funlockfile(FILE *stream);

// If the stream is currently locked, ftrylockfile()
// does nothing and immediately returns a nonzero value.
int ftrylockfile(FILE *stream);

// example
flockfile(stream);

fputs("List of treasure:\n", stream);
fputs("    (1) 500 gold coins\n", stream);
fputs("    (2) Wonderfully ornate dishware\n", stream);

funlockfile(stream);
```

###Unlocked Stream Operations
```C
#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <stdio.h>

int fgetc_unlocked(FILE *stream);
char *fgets_unlocked(char *str, int size, FILE *stream);
size_t fread_unlocked(void *buf, size_t size, size_t nr,
					  FILE *stream);
int fputc_unlocked(int c, FILE *stream);
int fputs_unlocked(const char *str, FILE *stream);
size_t fwrite_unlocked(void *buf, size_t size, size_t nr,
					   FILE *stream);
int fflush_unlocked(FILE *stream);
int feof_unlocked(FILE *stream);
int ferror_unlocked(FILE *stream);
int fileno_unlocked(FILE *stream);
void clearerr_unlocked(FILE *stream);
```
##Critiques of Standard I/O
The biggest complaint with standard I/O is the performance impact from the double copy.
